This repository provides code for replicating simulation and data analysis figures in 
"Bayesian inference for copy number intra-tumoral heterogeneity from single-cell RNA-sequencing data"

- simulation 1 replicates Figure 2 (B, C): Clustering ARI compared with inferCNV, CN state accuracy

- simulation 2 replicates Figure 3 (E, F, G): Comparison with HoneyBADGER and inferCNV in clustering ARI, CN state accuracy and K selection.

- Melnoma_analysis replicates Figure 4 and S7. 

- ATC_analysis replicates Figure 5.

- sensitivity_analysis replicates Figure S4: Impact of parameter \omega and T on the selection of cluster number K.
